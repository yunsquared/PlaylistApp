# App Development iOS Course

Mobile app for users to personalize playlists and modify song titles and details in real time 

Challenge prompts #1, #2

Feature was added allowing user to swipe left on any song to remove from the playlist

A rightBarButtonItem was also included for an "Add" feature, which will take user to new view controller, allowing them to input a song name, artist, and album name. Since a feature was not yet created to allow user to add their own images, a default image was selected for all new song entries
